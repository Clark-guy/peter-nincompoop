This is a game that I'm making. really i'm just doing this 
to learn to use pygame, i don't really see this game ever 
being particularly interesting to anybody. a lot of the 
code in this is pretty poorly done so you probably should
not use any of this for reference unless you're me.

babdabdabb i want to make this readme longer but I have 
nothing else to say

cool band names:

tin cookie
splat town
frog boobs
understate
interstate

i don't really think any of those band names would be all
that good. i just wanted to make a little square out of
text. That being said i kind of like frog boobs
