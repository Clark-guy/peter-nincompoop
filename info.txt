TODO list

fix time.sleep to use game clock instead
entering buildings / new areas
fix it so map doesnt move but player / camera does
collision
other characters
make an actual map / characters / have an actual idea for a game


to do stardew style relationships, add a value for each new person which refers to how well you know them

make it seem like the characters continued to exist even when you left the room



guy will start in a river after a fire
	--water mechanics? different walk/still animations for when on water, or map changes entirely
river is like a metaphor for life and shit like biblical rebirth also rivers sustain life / womb
fire is kinda that too i guess whatever more like the end of life

guy will be like umm what do i um do? 

where do i want this story to go
	0 build relationships with people
		0 help rebuild place after fire, meet new people
	0 character levl ups and shit to attain (why? to get better loot? what drives most games in this way)
